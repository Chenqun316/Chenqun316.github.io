# Research Interests

## Risk Analysis for AI
  Due to the uncertainty and un-interpretability of DNN, I focus on risk analysis for deep AI models, i.e. analyzing and evaluating the risk that an AI model mislabels a target instance in a classification problem. Risk analysis is by itself an important and interesting research problem. Moreover, it can have a profound impact on the design and implementation of core machine learning operations, e.g. active selection of training instances, model training and model selection.

## Gradual Machine Learning
  Even though deep learning has achieved tremendous success, its efficacy usually relies on a large number of accurately labeled training data. Unfortunately, high-quality labeled data may not be readily available in real AI applications.

  I have proposed a new non-i.i.d paradigm of machine learning, namely Gradual machine learning (GML). Given a classification task, GML begins with the easy instances, which can usually be automatically labeled by the machine with high accuracy, and then gradually labels more challenging instances based on evidential certainty by iterative factor inference. Compared with traditional i.i.d learning (e.g. deep learning), GML is more interpretable and requires less or even no manually labeled data.
